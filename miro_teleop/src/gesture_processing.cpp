 * Gesture Processing Service function.
 * From gesture pose, identifies the pointed position on the plane.
 *
 * The Gesture Pose from motion capture contains both the position and 
 * orientation of the rigid body. 
 *
 * Assuming that the initial pose was with the 
 * hand (or arm) facing the x axis, the direction vector is then computing by
 * performing a rotation on (1,0,0) of the quaternion received via the 
 * tf::quatRotate() function.
 *
 * Then, the position on the plane is obtained algebraically by the intersection
 * of the direction line with the plane z = H
